# SCiLS LAB 2014 CSV TRANSPOSAL TOOL

This Python 3 script converts the CSV exported from SCiLS Lab 2014 into a more common CSV/TXT file, more easily imported by other programs such as mMass or Microsoft Excel.

This tool takes as input the CSV that is exported from SCiLS Lab 2014 software: it removes the additional information and only keeps the m/z and intensity values; then it transposes it, so that the CSV file can be easily imported into other programs such as mMass or Microsoft Excel.
